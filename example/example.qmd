```{r}
#| label: load-libraries-data
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)

books_raw <- read_json(
  "https://api.andrewheiss.com/books_simple?year=2023", 
  simplifyVector = TRUE
)

total <- books_raw$count

monthly_counts <- books_raw$monthly_count

avg_rating <- books_raw$full_data |> 
  summarize(avg = mean(rating)) |> 
  pull(avg)
```

In 2023, I read `r total` books, with an average rating of `r round(avg_rating, 2)` of 5 stars.

@fig-monthly-count shows what that looked like over time:

```{r}
#| label: fig-monthly-count
#| fig-cap: "Books read in each month of 2023"
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3
#| echo: false

monthly_counts |> 
  mutate(read_month_fct = fct_rev(fct_inorder(read_month_fct))) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = read_month_fct)) +
  geom_col(fill = "darkred") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Count")
```
