# Example dashboard

In v1.4, Quarto introduced the [dashboard format](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/), and we can use it to add Observable JS chunks that grab and display live data from our API.

Here's an example that shows a bunch of different dashboard features + Arquero manipulation. This only uses the Goodreads API endpoint, which uses token-less GET requests. If you wanted to show something that required a token, you could add a login page to the dasbhoard, like I've done here too.

```{=html}
<p><a class="btn btn-warning btn-lg" target="_blank" href="dashboard/index.html">View dashboard in new window &raquo;</a></p>
```
